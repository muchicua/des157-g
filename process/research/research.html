    <h1> Imagining America </h1>
  </header>


  <section>
    <p>Imagining America is a national consortium of different colleges and universities that bring together cultural organizations, faculty, and students from different disciplines to create/redefines narratives.
      This organization was launched at a 1999 White House Conference by the initiation of the White House Millennium Council, University of Michigan, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>They have as vision a creative community that is built by a contribution of knowledge, where each individual collaborates to create “healthy, vibrant, and joyful communities.” As mission, they seek to bring together scholars, artist,
      designers, humanist, and organizers to change the culture and transform the already existing institutional structures and social issues.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#F9ED32"> “We aim for these networks to be a collaborative, sustainable, and action-oriented conduit for changing academic cultures and practices and strengthening civic life.” </b></p>
    <p>Imagining America aims to bring people together as one to imagine better ways of living, learning and working together. This is based on their values:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>It is important to struggle with the idea of ‘America’.</li>
  <li>Creative culture is an important site of liberation.</li>
  <li>Nothing is completely new.</li>
  <li>Our work must be radically inclusive.</li>
  <li>How we learn and work with one another matters.</li>
  <li>Living up to our values requires institutional and societal change.</li>
  <li>Organized ideas matter in the project of personal, institutional, and societal transformation.</li>
</ul>
